                <p class="text-muted">We are an African company who have travelled around our vibrant continent in the search for the finest natural ingredients. During our journey of discovery we came across the Swahili word, "DAKARI" which translates in English to be "HAPPINESS". Immediately we knew that this name captivated the very essence of what our brand would bring to the world. When combining "AFRI" with "DAKARI" We get "AFRIDAKARI" which means African Happiness. We at Afrikadari know that hair isnâ€™t simply an extension of our body. We know that hair is a reflection of our identity. Our hair is seen by the world, yet it is something that is extremely personal. This personal relationship between hair and self-esteem is evident throughout history, philosophy, and even religion. Hair is symbolic of our identity, freedom, culture and beauty.
                <br/>
                We at Afridakari had the vision to create a range of products that is made from the finest natural ingredients, which is scientifically proven to work and will bring you happiness by giving the life back to your hair.
